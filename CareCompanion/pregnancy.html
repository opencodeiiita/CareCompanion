    <p>Pregnancy is a transformative journey requiring comprehensive care for both the mother and the baby. Prenatal care includes regular check-ups, ultrasounds, and blood tests to monitor the baby's development and the mother's health. Nutrition plays a vital role; a diet rich in folic acid, iron, calcium, and essential vitamins supports healthy growth. Hydration and adequate rest are equally important. Exercise, such as prenatal yoga or walking, helps maintain fitness and prepare the body for labor. Planning for childbirth, whether vaginal or cesarean, involves discussing options with healthcare providers. Emotional support from loved ones and addressing mental health needs contribute to a positive pregnancy experience.</p>
