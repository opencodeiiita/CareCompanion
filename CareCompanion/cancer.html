    <p>Cancer prevention focuses on proactive steps to reduce the risk of 
        developing cancer through early detection, screenings, and healthy 
        lifestyle choices. Regular screenings like mammograms and Pap tests are critical for early detection of breast and cervical cancers. The HPV vaccine offers protection against cervical and other cancers caused by the human papillomavirus. Lifestyle adjustments such as maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding tobacco, and limiting alcohol consumption can significantly lower cancer risks. Awareness of family medical history can help identify genetic predispositions, allowing for personalized prevention plans. Consulting healthcare 
        providers ensures you stay informed about the best prevention strategies.</p>
