    <p>PCOS is a common hormonal disorder affecting people of reproductive age, 
        characterized by symptoms such as irregular periods, excessive hair growth, 
        acne, and weight gain. It results from hormonal imbalances, including high insulin and androgen levels, which disrupt ovulation. Although PCOS has no cure, it can be managed effectively. Lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight, are crucial for controlling symptoms. Medications like hormonal contraceptives regulate periods, while metformin can improve insulin sensitivity. Fertility treatments are available for those experiencing difficulty conceiving. Addressing PCOS early reduces the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes,
        heart disease, and uterine cancer..</p>
